Configuration-only template for setting up a gateway
service and Gateway objects.

Recommended to use istio-gateway-NAMESPACE as the
name of the install.


# Upgrade in istio-system

It is recommended to install a new gateway and service
in a separate namespace, and update the DNS to the new gateway
after testing.

If you must continue using the IP and services allocated to
the istio-ingressgateway in istio-system, follow those steps.

First, install a new deployment using the deployment-only chart.

If the previous install was done with helm you should
install the configs, using 'istio-ingressgateway' name.
This will 'take over' the Service object, but remove/prune the
old deployment.

```
helm -n istio-system upgrade --install istio-ingressgateway manifests/charts/gateway-config
```

If the previous install was done with istio operator, use
https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7649

```
 kubectl -n istio-system annotate service istio-ingressgateway app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
 kubectl -n istio-system annotate service istio-ingressgateway meta.helm.sh/release-name=istio-gateway-config
 kubectl -n istio-system label service istio-ingressgateway app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm

```
